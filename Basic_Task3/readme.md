# Task-3: Image Encryption

## Description

This project focuses on implementing image encryption to ensure that images remain secure even when accessed over the internet. The goal is to encrypt images in such a way that they cannot be decrypted without a secure key, even if they are intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties. By delving into the basics of cybersecurity and cryptography, this project will enhance your understanding of image security and encryption techniques.
