# Task-1: Text Encryption Using Cryptographic Algorithms

## Description

This is a simple web application designed to encrypt and decrypt textual information entered by the user. The goal is to implement strong encryption techniques that produce different outputs even when the same input is provided. Users will be able to encrypt their text using various cryptographic algorithms and decrypt encrypted text back to its original form.
